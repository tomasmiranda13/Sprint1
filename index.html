I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best / and most grueling / time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a software Engineer at VR startup"</p>

I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were handy-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The aile team project, in particular, was  outstanding. It look my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often reffered to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. In certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "
